# Semantic Guardrails Enhancement

## Overview

The guardrail system now uses **TF-IDF semantic similarity** in addition to substring matching. This enables the system to block paraphrased or semantically similar harmful queries, not just exact phrase matches.

## How It Works

### Two-Stage Checking

1. **Substring Check (Fast)**: First checks for exact/near-exact matches
2. **Semantic Check (TF-IDF)**: If no substring match, computes cosine similarity between query and denylist phrases

### TF-IDF Semantic Matching

```python
# Initialization (at startup)
1. Transform denylist phrases to TF-IDF vectors using corpus vectorizer
2. L2-normalize vectors for cosine similarity computation
3. Store vectors in memory

# Query Check (at runtime)
1. Transform query to TF-IDF vector
2. L2-normalize query vector
3. Compute cosine similarity with all denylist vectors
4. If max similarity >= threshold (0.35), block the query
```

### Example Blocked Queries

**Direct Match (Substring)**:
- "instructions for illegal activity" → BLOCKED (exact match)
- "how to build a weapon" → BLOCKED (exact match)

**Semantic Match (TF-IDF)**:
- "guide to unlawful actions" → BLOCKED (similar to "instructions for illegal activity")
- "tutorial on creating weapons" → BLOCKED (similar to "how to build a weapon")
- "methods for harming oneself" → BLOCKED (similar to "self-harm methods")

**Allowed Queries**:
- "What is cosine similarity?" → ALLOWED (safe technical question)
- "How to build a web application?" → ALLOWED (different context)
- "How to improve system security?" → ALLOWED (legitimate security topic)

## Configuration

### File: `app/guardrails/denylist.py`

```python
# Toggle semantic checking on/off
USE_SEMANTIC_CHECK = True  # Set to False for substring-only

# Cosine similarity threshold (tune based on testing)
TFIDF_THRESHOLD = 0.35  # Range: 0.25-0.45
# - Lower (0.25): More strict, may have false positives
# - Higher (0.45): More lenient, may miss some paraphrases
```

## Testing

### Run Semantic Guardrail Tests

```powershell
# Make sure server is running first
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# In another terminal, run the test script
python test_semantic_guardrails.py
```

### Expected Output

## Architecture

### Initialization Flow

```
Startup (app/main.py)
  ↓
Initialize Retrieval Service
  ↓
Build TF-IDF Vectorizer (on corpus)
  ↓
Initialize Guardrail Vectors (app/guardrails/denylist.py)
  ├─ Transform denylist phrases using vectorizer
  ├─ L2-normalize vectors
  └─ Store in memory
```

### Query Flow

```
User Query
  ↓
Route Handler (app/routes/answer.py)
  ↓
Guardrail Service (app/services/guardrail_service.py)
  ↓
Denylist Check (app/guardrails/denylist.py)
  ├─ Substring check (fast)
  │   └─ If match → BLOCK
  └─ Semantic check (TF-IDF)
      ├─ Vectorize query
      ├─ Compute cosine similarity
      ├─ If similarity >= 0.35 → BLOCK
      └─ Else → ALLOW
```

## Advantages

### Why TF-IDF for Guardrails?

1. **Zero External Dependencies**: Uses existing vectorizer from retrieval system
2. **Fast**: Simple matrix multiplication (< 1ms per query)
3. **Interpretable**: Can see similarity scores for debugging
4. **Catches Paraphrases**: Blocks semantically similar queries
5. **Tunable**: Threshold can be adjusted based on false positive rate

### Comparison: Substring vs Semantic

| Feature | Substring | TF-IDF Semantic |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Speed | Very fast | Fast |
| Exact matches | ✅ | ✅ |
| Paraphrases | ❌ | ✅ |
| Synonyms | ❌ | ✅ |
| False positives | Very low | Low (tunable) |
| Dependencies | None | scikit-learn |

## Monitoring

### Guardrail Metrics

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/metrics
```

```json
{
  "denylist_hits": 12,  // Number of blocked queries
  "total_requests": 150,
  ...
}
```

### Server Logs

When semantic guardrail triggers:

```
🛡️ Semantic guardrail triggered: 'guide to unlawful actions' → 'instructions for illegal activity' (score: 0.487)
```

When substring guardrail triggers:

```
🛡️ Substring guardrail triggered: 'instructions for illegal activity' → 'instructions for illegal activity'
```

## Tuning Guidelines

### Adjusting Threshold

1. **Too Many False Positives** (blocking safe queries):
   - Increase `TFIDF_THRESHOLD` (try 0.40 or 0.45)
   - Review server logs to see similarity scores
   - Add safe queries to test suite

2. **Missing Paraphrases** (harmful queries getting through):
   - Decrease `TFIDF_THRESHOLD` (try 0.30 or 0.25)
   - Add more phrases to `DENYLIST`
   - Consider adding more diverse denylist examples

### Adding More Denylist Phrases

```python
# app/guardrails/denylist.py
DENYLIST: List[str] = [
    "instructions for illegal activity",
    "how to build a weapon",
    # Add more specific phrases
    "create fake documents",
    "bypass parental controls",
    # More phrases improve coverage
]
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Sentence Embeddings**: Upgrade from TF-IDF to sentence-transformers for better semantic capture
2. **Multiple Thresholds**: Different thresholds for different harm categories
3. **Context-Aware Blocking**: Consider query context before blocking
4. **Allowlist**: Explicit safe phrases to reduce false positives
5. **Metrics Dashboard**: Visualize blocked queries and similarity scores
